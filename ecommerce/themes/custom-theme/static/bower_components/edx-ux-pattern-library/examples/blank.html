edX Pattern Library Site: Blank View

About: Use this example (by copying this file's contents) to create independent, stand alone views for proofing and designing in the browser.

Things to note:

* this file uses a template that should only pull leverage the preset pattern-library source styling (true it still uses the documentation site's pldoc/css/main-*.css file, but documentation styles are scoped by class name to not conflict with any elements here).

* this view can only leverage styles rules for 1) any patterns already in the pattern library or any styles you added to the pldoc sass override partials

* your view will be viewable once you start Jekyll locally or through Github Pages hosting at [site path or url]/examples/[your view's name].html

- - -

Things to remember to do:

* add the appropriate view-* classes to the Jekyll metadata

* use best practices from our styleguides (https://github.com/edx/ux-pattern-library/wiki)

* add comments to your code to explain what you're doing

* delete views that are not needed any more or should not be part of the published documentation site

* for views that explain larger patterns (e.g. grids or modals), remember to add the appropriate element documentation and link to your view with "href="{{ site.baseurl }}/examples/[your view's name].html"

* have fun in the clean space!

* use the force!
